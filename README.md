# Convolutional_NeuralNet
Implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks in R using "mxnet "& in Python using "keras"

*Data set Description for implementation in R:*

I am using the Olivetti faces dataset. This dataset is a collection of 64Ã—64 pixel 0-256 greyscale images.

The dataset contains a total of 400 images of 40 subjects with just 10 samples for each subject.

The dataset is credited to AT&T Laboratories Cambridge.

*Data set Description for implementation in Python:*

Every MNIST data point has two parts: an image of a handwritten digit and a corresponding label.

Both the training set and test set contain images and their corresponding labels; for example the training images are mnist.train.images and the training labels are mnist.train.labels.

Each image is 28 pixels by 28 pixels. We can interpret this as a big array of numbers:
